					Biography
					<br>
				</div>
					<div class="bio-pull-txt">
						Helen Brauns is an Australian artist interested in capturing the vivid beauty of the Australian landscape. Her subjects include Murray River red gum trees, wildflowers, seascapes and the Australian bush. 
				</div>
				<div class="bio-block-container">
				<div class="half-block1">
					Brauns uses a vibrant contemporary style to recreate her subjects with acrylic paint on canvas. She creates strong compositions enhancing them by laying glazes of colour for depth and using strong brushstrokes to build texture. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Brauns discovered painting at 16 but did not pursue it as a career. After school, she studied fashion design at the Melbourne College of Textiles from 1980-82. In a career spanning 30 years in the newspaper and magazine advertising industry, she managed teams who created advertisements for print.
					<br>
					<br>
			
						In 2010, Brauns returned to her painting practice. Under the mentorship of Dawn Csutoros and David Chen she experimented with paints, brush techniques and subject matter to create her bold style. 
					<br>
					<br>
					In her free time, Brauns hikes, camps and skis her way around Australia and overseas accompanied by her friends and family. The Australian bush, deserts and mountains she has visited are the inspiration for her paintings.  Her goal as an artist is to create works that bring enjoyment to herself and others. She Lives in Melbourne, Australia.

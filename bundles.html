					The philosophy of this brand is to encourage creativity by getting your hands dirty. While an online presence is important to the brand, it is also nice to explore the analog, old school ways of interacting with customers. Everybody likes getting letters and stuff in the mail! This project explored how the letter medium can facilitate pleasant surprises and interesting hands-on experiences.

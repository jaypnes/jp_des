					Deadhead is a zine that aims to introduce readers to philosophy. In this case it is four issues on Nietzsche, covering four of his key ideas. The zines unfurl and combine together into a poster to communicate a fifth and overarching idea—the Übermensch (the Superman). The Superman is a psychologically evolved human being.

							 A budding Übermensch would need to apply teachings from the first four of Nietzsche’s ideas in order to possibly become one.

					This project answered the ISTD 2017 student brief ‘The Dead Wood Archive’. The brief asked to celebrate a randomly allocated book. An introductory anecdote was the major prompt of the brief.

					The anecdote was about the internet being an information superhighway with endless possibilities. However no matter how good a search engine is, you will end up at a dead wood archive—a book.
					The allocated book was a scholarly text called ‘Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy’ by Maudemarie Clarke.

					<div class="txt block">
					The problem is that this book requires a fundamental understanding of Nietzsche’s philosophy to be read. However, for the amateur, naive reader, Nietzsche’s text is hard to read without any supporting reference. Therein lies a problem with the text and, moreover, philosophy in general—it is inaccessible to the average reader.
